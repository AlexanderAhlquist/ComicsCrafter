# ComicsCrafter
This is a project to keep track of printed projects, and the estimated costs and where to purchase papers.

This is the largest project I've ever attempted.

The goal is to create a usable database that users can add, delete, and modify information about the costs associated with printing, and then have the site automatically calculate the costs associated with printing their comics projects. 

The backend of this project will be using MariaDB, and Java. The frontend is HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The project was assembled as a Maven project using Spring Boot.

##Project Requirements
###1. Project Structure, Standardization and Conventions 12%
####a.The project package structure should be shown in class, where the models, DAO/repositories, services, controllers, and exceptions, etc., have a package. Views or templates do not require a package - 2%.
My project has different packages for each aspect of the project.

####b.Each class should include comments to describe the class and the methods - 2%.
In each class, I at least included a small description of the class. For non-complex methods I didn't include descriptions, since the names of the methods explain the purpose of them.

####c. Have the project pushed into GitHub from the early stage of development and hosted on GitHub with a “readme” file documenting an overview of your project - 5%.
I pushed the project to GitHub as I was working on it. I started the project over a month ago, but I didn't really get momentum going until the end of class once we had learned about all of the aspects of the project which we had to include.

####d. Standard Java naming conventions should be followed
I did my best to follow standard naming conventions where possible.
