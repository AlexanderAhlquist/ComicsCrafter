# ComicsCrafter
This is a project to keep track of printed projects, and the estimated costs and where to purchase papers.

This is the largest project I've ever attempted.

The goal is to create a usable database that users can add, delete, and modify information about the costs associated with printing, and then have the site automatically calculate the costs associated with printing their comics projects. 

The backend of this project will be using MariaDB, and Java. The frontend is HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The project was assembled as a Maven project using Spring Boot.
